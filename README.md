secrets: Handles sensitive data like Wi-Fi and Adafruit credentials.

urequests: MicroPython library for HTTP requests.

machine: MicroPython module for hardware interaction on microcontrollers.

math: Standard Python library for mathematical functions.



In final_project_OpenCV.py:

cv2 (OpenCV): Library for computer vision tasks like image and video processing.

numpy: Essential for array manipulation, often used with OpenCV for images.

collections: Module providing alternatives to Pythonâ€™s built-in containers. Uses deque for efficient element removal and appending.

scipy.spatial.distance: SciPy module for calculating Euclidean distance, useful in path-length computations.

paho.mqtt.client: Manages MQTT communications in Python, suitable for standard environments.

my_secrets: Manages sensitive information like credentials, akin to the secrets module in the first script. Note: Be cautious about naming conflicts with a module using a secrets.py file internally.
